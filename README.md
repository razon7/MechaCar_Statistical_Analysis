RESULTS:
* The variables/coefficients vehicle length and ground clearance provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset
* The p-value for this model is 5.35e-11. This is much smaller than the assumed level of 0.05%, hence this indicates this is sufficient to reject our null hypothesis.   this concludes that the slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero.
* This linear model predict that it has an r-squared value of 0.7149.This is approximately 71% of all mpg predictions which is determined by this model, which infers     multiple regression model does predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively.

Deliverable 2:

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
   The Suspension Coil dataset provided for the MechaCar contains the results of testing the weight capacities of multiple suspension coils from multiple production lots to determine consistency.

The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?
Deliverable 3 
## T-Tests on Suspension Coils

perform t-tests to determine if all manufacturing lots and each lot individually are statistically different from the population mean of 1,500 pounds per square inch.
In your README, create a subheading ## T-Tests on Suspension Coils, then briefly summarize your interpretation and findings for the t-test results. Include screenshots of the t-test to support your summary.

Deliverable 4
 ## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition.

You will earn a perfect score for Deliverable 4 by completing all requirements below:
In your README, create a subheading ## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition.
Write a short description of a statistical study that can quantify how the MechaCar performs against the competition. In your study design, think critically about what metrics would be of interest to a consumer: for a few examples, cost, city or highway fuel efficiency, horse power, maintenance cost, or safety rating.
In your description, address the following questions:
What metric or metrics are you going to test?
What is the null hypothesis or alternative hypothesis?
What statistical test would you use to test the hypothesis? And why?
What data is needed to run the statistical test?

The statistical study design has the following:
A metric to be tested is mentioned
A null hypothesis or an alternative hypothesis is described 
A statistical test is described to test the hypothesis 
The data for the statistical test is described
